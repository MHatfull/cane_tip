# 3D printable white cane tip

This project is to make it more cost effective to replace the tip of a white cane when it wears out.


## The problem
When using a cane tip, they wear out in weeks with heavy use. The constant contact with the ground wears them down into a point and then they start to snag on every imperfection in the pavement.

To replace the tip, you would normally end up replacing both the roller ball, bearing and hook mechanism which poses several problems.
* If you accidentally let go of the elastic that runs through the cane whilst changing the tip, this can be very fiddly to retrieve.
* It is wasteful to throw away the parts that are still in good working order.

## This solution
This project aims to address these issues by making it easy to produce the cane tip yourself. If you, or someone you know, has a 3D printer then you should be able to replace the worn out tip without buying a new one. The cost of 3D filament is about 1/10th that of the price of the official tips. A small benefit is that you may prefer to choose your own colour or material, as you'll be making the tip then you have total control.

# Instructions
## What you'll need
* A standard rollerblade bearing (22mm x 7mm)
* A 3D printer
* The toughest filament you can find
* A piece of string

## How to make it
This comes in 2 parts. The insert and the tip. Fitting the insert initially can be a bit fiddly but should only need to be done once. The tip can then be reprinted over and over and fitted onto the bearing whenever it needs replacing.

1. Print 2 copies of the insert. You'll want to slice this lying on the long flat face so the layer lines aren't going to shear with the force on the tip.
1. Tie a loop in your string a few cm long.
1. Remove the old cane tip.
1. Pass the loop of string through the elastic in the cane, and then back through itself. This will secure the loop to the elastic.
1. Pull on the elastic until you see a white piece of plastic pop out the end of the cane. This is to hold the elastic in place while you change the tip and goes back into the cane later.
1. Place the string in the channel of one of the inserts with the knot in the larger area.
1. Place the other part of the insert over the top of the string, sandwiching it in the channel with the knot in the void.
1. Check that the string is secure and won't pull out of the inserts when it's held firmly together. If it's easy to pull out then you may need thicker string.
1. Carefully lower the insert into the cane, allowing the bore of the cane to hold the pieces in place. This should mean the insert is held together with the string attached to the elastic, holding everything under tension.
1. Push the bearing onto the tip of the insert, this can be quite tough so you may need to press it down against a hard surface to get it to fit in. This is by design as you don't want this falling off when it's in use.


The tricky bit is now done. You should never need to do this again unless something goes particularly wrong in the future.

You can now print the tip file with the hole straight up using supports to ensure the base of the tip prints properly. Push the part onto the bearing until it is seated against the lip. You can do this again when it wears out, thereby only needing to replace the ball.

## Changing the tip

1. Gently pull on the old roller ball until you see the insert.
1. Hold the insert so the two halves don't separate, tghis would mean the string would come free and the elastic would disappear inside the cane.
1. Keep pulling until the string appears.
1. Pull on the string until the white piece of plastic on the elastic is visible.
1. Use this to grab keep the elastic in place while you change the tip.
1. Using a string grip (or pair of pliers if needed), pull the insert away from the tip.
1. If the bearing is left on the insert, make sure it is pushed into it's usual, fully seated position. otherwise use a screwdriver or similar to lever out the bearing from the tip and put it back onto the insert.
1. Push the new tip onto the bearing, making sure it is fully seated.
1. Slowly lower the whole assembly back into the cane, making sure the insert doesn't loose grip of the string.
