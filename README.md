# 3D printable white cane tip

This project is to make it more cost effective to replace the tip of a white cane when it wears out.


## The problem
When using a cane tip, they wear out in weeks with heavy use. The constant contact with the ground wears them down into a point and then they start to snag on every imperfection in the pavement.

To replace the tip, you would normally end up replacing both the roller ball, bearing and hook mechanism which poses several problems.
* If you accidentally let go of the elastic that runs through the cane whilst changing the tip, this can be very fiddly to retrieve.
* It is wasteful to throw away the parts that are still in good working order.

## This solution
This project aims to address these issues by making it easy to produce the cane tip yourself. If you, or someone you know, has a 3D printer then you should be able to replace the worn out tip without buying a new one. The cost of 3D filament is about 1/10th that of the price of the official tips. A small benefit is that you may prefer to choose your own colour or material, as you'll be making the tip then you have total control.

# Instructions
## What you'll need
* A standard rollerblade bearing (22mm x 7mm)
* A 3D printer
* The toughest filament you can find
* A piece of string

## How to make it
This comes in 3 parts. The insert, a washer and the tip. Fitting the insert initially can be a bit fiddly but should only need to be done once. The tip can then be reprinted over and over and fitted onto the bearing whenever it needs replacing.

1. Print 2 copies of the insert. You'll want to slice this lying on the long flat face so the layer lines aren't going to shear with the force on the tip.
1. Print the washer. This is so the cane doesn't press directly onto the bearing and stop it from rotating freely.
1. Print the tip. You can do this with the large flat surface face down. Use as many perimeters as you can, I use 12. The more the better as these are what will wear away as the cane is in use.
1. Insert the bearing into the large hole in the tip. It will be tight, this is on purpose so it doesn't come off in use. You may have to use a vice or similar tool to push it hard enough, you may be able to do it by pressing hard against a hard surface.
1. Push the 2 pieces of insert, back-to-back, through the bearing.
1. Push the washer over the insert with the thicker side facing the bearing.
1. Pull on the old cane tip until you see a white piece of plastic pop out the end of the cane. This is to hold the elastic in place while you change the tip and goes back into the cane later.
1. Remove the old tip.
1. Pass the string through the elastic in the cane, and then through the holes in the insert. Tie a knot so it forms a loop connecting the insert to the elastic. This will secure the bearing to the cane.
1. Lower the new tip into the cane.

When you need to replace the tip, you can press a metal tool through the hole in the bottom of the tip in order to remove it from the bearing and press a new tip onto the bearing.
